Feature - Created a Contact Us page in which customers can send questions and an Admin Email Inbox where an admin receives questions from customers and reply back to the customers via Email using SendGrid email API. Implemented server-side pagination by sorting and filtering via SQL to optimize the email system. Created a framework for the blog management system that will allow users and cooks to create and read blogs in the future. 

Strategy â€“ Using SQL built data tables and store procedures, a C# service class and REST endpoints were implemented with Web.Api to handle incoming requests and return valid responses.
